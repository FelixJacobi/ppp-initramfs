# On local (non-NFS) mounts, interfaces matching this pattern are

# The special value 'none' keeps all interfaces up and preserves routing

#
# On local (non-NFS) mounts, the network stack and pppd are started
# asynchronously at init-premount stage.  This value specifies the
# maximum number of seconds to wait (while the network/pppd are
# being configured) at init-bottom stage before terminating pppd and
# bringing the network down.
# If the timeout is too short, and if the boot process is not blocking
# on user input supplied via SSHd (ie no remote unlocking), then the
# initrd might pivot to init(1) too early, thereby causing a race
# condition between network configuration from initramfs vs from the
# normal system.
